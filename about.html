									<h1>About Me</h1>
								</header>
								<p>I am currently a student working towards my MS in Geospatial Technologies at the Univeristy of Washington - Tacoma. I previously earned a BA in Geography with a focus on GIS from the University of Washington - Seattle in 2018, with a minor in Architecture. I am currently attending grad school because I want to further develop the skills I learned in undergrad and do more advanced analysis with GIS. I have always been fascinated by maps and data, going through several atlases when I was younger. I have also always been fascinated by the outdoors and the environment, especially green technology; part of that is due to my experiences as a Scout as well as my attendance at SAMI, a largely outdoor high school in Point Defiance Park that focuses on science and math.</p>
								<p>I was previously an intern at the Tacoma Rescue Mission warehouse and donation center during my junior year of high school in the winter of 2013. I later briefly worked for Tacoma Metro Parks as a maintenance assistant from August through September 2015. I also worked at summer camp for Pacific Harbors Council for four seasons, from 2015 to 2018. I am an Eagle Scout and have participated in numerous volunteer projects with my troop. Most recently, I took on a part-time job as a recess attendant at Downing Elementary School in February 2020, but had to stop in March after schools closed due to COVID-19. I plan on returning to this position next year when schools reopen.</p>
								<p>As an empathetic person, I strive to make the world a better place by making data more accessible to everyone.  My light-hearted and caring nature makes me a good team player and my creative and analytical skills combined allow me to present data in map form in the best possible user-friendly format.</p>

									<h1>Design Biography</h1>
								</header>
								<p>Effective map design is presenting and representing data in a way that is easy to understand while also being aesthetically pleasant. When designing a map, I believe that my most important job is to present and represent data in a format that is accessible to all potential users, regardless of their ability level or possible disability. In addition, the map should look aesthetically pleasing but not cluttered, confusing, or garish, as this would distract the user from the data.  I achieve this by choosing colors that are thematically recognizable, such as using blue to represent water or red to represent heat. I select a palette that stands out without being too flashy as well as being colorblind friendly whenever possible. I also use symbols that are easily associated with the data that I am representing, such as a school house to represent a school. My goal with my maps is to make the overall focal point be on the data itself so that the eye is naturally drawn to it, with various other descriptive elements such as the title and legend balanced around the perimeter. I strongly believe that maps should always be trustworthy; they should reflect the data accurately and not attempt to sensationalize it or skew the data or try to mislead people. While the map may be able to display a message, the map user should also be able to draw their own conclusions. These are the guidelines that I strive to follow when I make a map. </p>
