									<h1>About Me</h1>
								</header>
								<p>I am currently a student working towards my MS in Geospatial Technologies at the Univeristy of Washington - Tacoma. I previously earned a BA in Geography with a focus on GIS from the University of Washington - Seattle in 2018, with a minor in Architecture. I am currently attending grad school because I want to further develop the skills I learned in undergrad and do more advanced analysis with GIS. I have always been fascinated by maps and data, going through several atlases when I was younger. I have also always been fascinated by the outdoors and the environment, especially green technology; part of that is due to my experiences as a Scout as well as my attendance at SAMI, a largely outdoor high school in Point Defiance Park that focuses on science and math.</p>
								<p>I was previously an intern at the Tacoma Rescue Mission warehouse and donation center during my junior year of high school in the winter of 2013. I later briefly worked for Tacoma Metro Parks as a maintenance assistant from August through September 2015. I also worked at summer camp for Pacific Harbors Council for four seasons, from 2015 to 2018. I am an Eagle Scout and have participated in numerous volunteer projects with my troop. Most recently, I took on a part-time job as a recess attendant at Downing Elementary School in February 2020, but had to stop in March after schools closed due to COVID-19. I plan on returning to this position next year when schools reopen.</p>
