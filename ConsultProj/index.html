		<h1>Evolution of the Taipei Subway!</h1>
		<img src="images/Map.gif" alt="How the different lines of the Taipei Subway have grown over time" title="Evolution of the Taipei Subway"/>

		<p>For this project, I was tasked by Chian-Yu to create a map of Taipei’s subway system in relation to the demographics of the city by district and how they have changed over time. However, I had difficulty finding GIS data for the demographics and district shapes for Taipei due to the official data portals being in Chinese, so I decided to simply focus on how the subway system has changed and expanded over time, as I was thankfully able to find shapefiles for both stations and lines. I manually edited the data to include the opening month of each station (which I was able to find online) and edited each line segment of each route to include the opening date of the oldest station on each segment, so that if you were to move through the data over time it would show the lines growing as more stations are added.</p>
		<p>This was originally going to be a more interactive map where you could click on stations and move the time slider yourself, but I experienced technical difficulties when uploading the data to ArcGIS Online that prevented the layers form showing at all. I now suspect it was due to how the date data was formatted on my end. Ultimately, I decided to settle on making an animated GIF of the subway system growing over time, which may not be interactive but it still shows how the subway has evolved and grown. Each of the lines are color-coded based on how they colored in real life, while the stations are represented as dots along the lines. As requested by Chian-Yu, the data is displayed on a gray base map as Taipei tends to be rainy and it also makes the colored data stand out better. Overall, this project was a major learning experience for me and there are lots of things I’d change if I could do it again, like fixing the date formatting or using a Leaflet slider, and maybe looking harder for district and demographic data.</p>
