									<h2>My Portfolio</h2>
									<p>I believe that data should be accessible to all and easy to understand, while also looking pleasant. I am also especially interested in studying public transit as well as the environment. These are some examples of mapping projects I have worked on throughout college that I am particularly proud of, as I believe they showcase my philosophy on data as well as my interests, and in general show the evolution of my skills throughout the program.</p>

									<p>This project was a final project I did for GEOG 360 in my Junior year of undergrad up in UW-Seattle back in Spring 2017. I am choosing to include it because I am fairly proud of it and also because it's where I started using GIS to analyze public transit. Here I analyzed bus routes in Seattle did all sorts of geospatial analysis using ArcGIS, such as calculating the percentage of census tracts' area that was within walking distance of bus stops and comparing that to the average income of each tract.</p>

									<p>This assignment was the the first major mapping project in the graduate program, as well as the web-map that used data that I found myself. Here, I was required to find two different sets of GeoJSON data and display them on the same web-map. I was also required to use different symbols to display at least one set of data. I chose to map out different schools and compare their proximity to local bus routes, with schools being colored based on their grade level. We were also required to incorporate at least one Leaflet plugin; in this case, I went with a legend. Once again, I am focussing on mapping out bus routes, taking some inspiration from my GEOG 360 Final. I even chose to display schools this time, which was something I origninally wanted to include in the previous project, but didn't get aroud to. This lab was the first time I had used the leaflet API to create a map, so it doesn't look perfect; I was origninally intending to use custom symbols instead of just circles, but had trouble implementing them.</p>

									<p>The third lab in TGIS 503 introduced us to the Mapbox API, which was more advanced than the Leaflet API we previously worked with. For this lab, we had to display two seperate maps on the same webpage, and use them to display different types of data. For the first map, I chose to map the mean centers of population for each county in Washington state, with each marker having a clickable popup showing the names of each county as well as the population and coordinates for the center point. The second map is a choropleth map showing the population of census tract in Pierce County. This lab was more difficult, as I kept having trouble with some of the data for the second map and had to change plans, and because Mapbox's documentation is admittedly not quite as good as Leaflet's.</p>

									<p>This assignment required us to display multiple pieces of related data across two maps and at least different APIS in order to tell a story. I chose to draw inspiration from my previous two labs and make a page comparing density of Pierce Transit bus stops to population. The first map is a Mapbox map displaying a heatmap of bus stops, while the second map is a Leaflet choropleth displaying the population of Pierce County census tracts overlaid on bus stops. I would've preffered to have mapped population density, but at the time could not figure out what the area of the census tracts were with the data I was using.</p>

									<a href="documents\506_Lab_1.pdf" target="_blank" class="image fit"><img src="images\EOIMap.png" alt="506 Lab 1" /></a>
									<p>For this project, we had to map out various factors affecting educational opportunity in King County and compare them to each other. We then had to take the indicators and combine them into a single educational opportunity index (EOI) for each census tract. We also had to come up with our own weighting for calculating the EOI, as some values were shown to more heavily affect opportunity than others. This was the first time I had used data to calcualte an index, and while it took some effort, and few recalculations, I was fairly satisfied with how the maps turned out. Once again, I'm using warm colors on a gray background, as I believe this makes the data standout and easier to read. It also shows that I've largely gotten the hang of making choropleth maps.</p>

										<h2><a href="documents/Couch 506 Lab 2.pdf" target="_blank">Flood Risk Assessment<br />
										in Cowlitz County</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="documents/Couch 506 Lab 2.pdf" target="_blank" class="image fit"><img src="images\CowlitzFloods.png" alt="506 Lab 2" /></a>
									<p>Here I was tasked with comparing FEMA flood hazard zones with social vulnerabilty index (SVI) of census tracts, as well as 3 different critical parts of infrastructure, in order to assess the risk of a populated area if a flood were to occur. I decided to focus on Cowlitz County, Washington as it is right next to the Columbia River and the Cowlitz River, with a more specific focus on the city of Longview. The three pieces of critical infrastructure I chose to examine were schools, cell towers, and electrical substations, as I believe they are important fro education and potential shelter, communicaton, and power to keep things running respectively. Flood hazard areas are colored by zone type and subtype, with zones of the same type but different subtypes having the same color but different shades. Rather than directly showing both choropleth layers as once by overlaying one on the other and setting one to use patterns instead of colors, I instead decided to produce an ArcGIS Online App that adds a slider that users can use to swipe between the flood risk and SVI layers, which can be viewed <a href="https://arcg.is/1ezn8i1" target="_blank">here.</a> This was the first time I have made an ArcGIS app, so it's not as optimized as it could be, but it was a learning experience.</p>

									<a href="documents\506_Lab_3.pdf" target="_blank" class="image fit"><img src="images\Risk Index.png" alt="506 Lab 3" /></a>
									<p>This project had us use LiDAR data to perform an analysis of our choosing; for this, I chose to study the risk of landslides in Mount Rainier National Park using information derived from LiDAR data. For the sake of simplicity, I only used two indicators for landslide risk: slope, and curvature. Using the digital elevation model (DEM) raster provided with data, I was able to calculate these indicators using built-in functions of ArcGIS Pro, and then calculated a risk index by assigning points a one or a zero for each indicator based on whether they fell within a certain range or not, and then added them. This was the first time I have ever worked with LiDAR data, as well as the first time I've used and analyzed raster data with ArcGIS, so I found this project to be very useful in developing my skills, which will help me when I need to perform similar analysis in the future.</p>

										<h2><a href="ConsultProj\index.html" target="_blank">Evolution of the<br />
										Taipei Subway System</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="ConsultProj\index.html" target="_blank" class="image fit"><img src="images\TaipeiMRT.png" alt="505 Consultant Project" /></a>
									<p>I was tasked by one of my classmates to make a map of Taipei's subway system and how it affected demographic data for each district over time. However, I was unable to find adequate demographic data by district for Taipei online, so I ended up making a map of how the subway system has evolved over time, by showing how new stops and lines of been added. This was originally going to be an interactive map with a time slider that would've also allowed users to click on the stops themselves, but I had difficulties uploading this to ArcGIS online as the time data kept getting wiped, which I suspect was a formattng issue, so I resorted to making an animated GIF showing the evolution of the subway system from its inception to the current year. I raninto a lot of issues with this project, form not finding data to not being able to upload, and even issues with editing and exporting the GIF, including a few crashes, but despite these challenges I'm still mostly satisfied with what I was able to produce, and it tought me how to work with time data in ArcGIS as well as how to create an animation. If I had to do this project again, I would probably resort to making an interactive Leaflet or MapBox map instead so I could keep the interactive elements, or reformat the time data to make it work properly with ArcGIS online.</p>

									<p>For my capstone project, I focused on public transit and related it to the environment. More specifically, I studied some of the negative aspects of public transit, such as increased air and noise pollution around transit centers and depots and come up with solutions to address those issues. I primarily focused on data collected for New York City. While the results of my study ultimately did not find a correlation between bus depots and air and noise pollution, it was still as interesting project that expanded my knowledge of GIS, specifically using geographically weighted regression.</p>
