		<p>Mount Rainier is a dormant stratovolcano that is expected to have a violent eruption some time in the future, not unlike it's smaller cousin Mount Saint Helens. Because of the large amount of glacial ice covering the mountain, and explosive eruption is expected to produce extremely large mudflows, called "lahars" that will devastate a significantly large area along the various river valleys, which include various towns and settlements. It's possible that some of the largest lahars may even reach the Port of Tacoma, where the Puyallup River drains into Puget Sound; this would cause major damage to local industry as well as some residential areas. Additionally, an eruption would also inundate a large portion of the state with volcanic ash. Due to it's size and it's proximity to major urban areas, it is considered one of the most dangerous </p>

		<p>Thankfully, seismic activity at Mount Rainier is constantly monitored, so we would likely know in advance when an eruption was about to occur and prepare in advance. Still, it is expected to be one of the worst disasters the country has ever seen.</p>
