		<h1>The Beauty of Mount Rainier!</h1>

		<p>Standing tall at 14,410 ft, Mount Rainier is the tallest peak in Washington State and the Cascades. Dominating the skylines of Seattle and Tacoma, the mountain has been one the state's most iconic landmarks, and is by far the most iconic natural feature. Many local brands are named after the mountain, including Rainier Beer and the Tacoma Rainiers baseball team. The city of Tacoma itself is even named after the mountain's original native name, "Tacoma." (Alternatively "Tahoma")</p>
		<p>Rainier is the most glaciated mountain in the contiguous United States, sporting 26 glaciers. These glaciers cover most of the mountain year-round, and feed many rivers throughout Washington state, including the Nisqually, Puyallup, Carbon, White, and Cowlitz Rivers. The rivers provide fresh water to the local ecosytems stretching between the Cascades and the Puget Sound, making the mountain very important.</p>

		<p>However, with great beauty comes great risk. While the mountain is an iconic symbol of the state, it is also a ticking time bomb that poses a grave danger to much of the state.</p>
